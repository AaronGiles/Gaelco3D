Notes
-----
* There is no frameskipping. If your computer can't handle it,
  too bad.

* There are known clipping issues.

* I've had an annoying hanging sound that never stopped, but
  haven't figured out why.

* It occasionally crashes to the desktop.

* This is just for fun, I doubt it will ever get fully polished
  and finished.
